# COLOR CONSISTENCY SOLUTION & IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

## üé® **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

- **Major Issue**: Each service page uses different color schemes (blue for roofing, green for HVAC, etc.)
- **Impact**: Breaks brand consistency, reduces professional credibility, hurts conversion rates
- **Priority**: **HIGHEST** - This is the first thing users notice

---

## ‚úÖ **SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. Enhanced Tailwind Color System**

Created a unified brand color system in `tailwind.config.js`:

```css
// Primary Brand Colors
'rgl-red': '#C85A5A',           // Main brand color
'rgl-red-dark': '#B84848',      // Darker variation
'rgl-red-light': '#D67373',     // Lighter variation

// Service Category Accent Colors (subtle variations while maintaining brand)
'rgl-service': {
  'roofing': '#C85A5A',         // Primary red (same as brand)
  'hvac': '#CA5F5A',            // Slightly warmer red
  'moving': '#C85F65',          // Slightly pinker red
  'solar': '#C8645A',           // Slightly orange-red
  'marketing': '#B84848',       // Darker red
}

// Gradient Support Colors
'rgl-gradient': {
  'start': '#C85A5A',
  'middle': '#B84848',
  'end': '#A83E3E',
}
```

### **2. Roofing Leads Page - COMPLETED ‚úÖ**

**Before**: Blue color scheme (blue-600, blue-700, blue-800)
**After**: Brand red gradient and consistent styling

**Changes Made**:

- Hero section: `from-rgl-gradient-start via-rgl-gradient-middle to-rgl-gradient-end`
